## Project
The project here is based on Maker.io'r [Getting started with STM32 - Introduction to FreeRTOS](https://www.digikey.se/en/maker/projects/getting-started-with-stm32-introduction-to-freertos/ad275395687e4d85935351e16ec575b1).
If you want to learn more, Digi-Key with Shawn Hymel has a [whole series](https://youtu.be/F321087yYy4) on the topic of RTOS.
