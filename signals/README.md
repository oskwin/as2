# Signals
This folder contains screenshots from the Saleae Logic Analyzer used to capture relevant signals related to the peripheral on which the branch focuses on.

In the SPI branch, we can also see the setpup screenshots for the CubeIDE and the CubeMonitor. The CubeMonitor is used to get the variable as a signal. Further instructions to set it up with your board can be found at [https://youtu.be/bTJhqHWniZE](https://youtu.be/bTJhqHWniZE).
