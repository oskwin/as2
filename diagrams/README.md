# UML 2.0 Diagrams

This folders contains UML diagrams to document and clarify the current application.
Among the diagrams are use case, state, and activity diagrams.

###### Description

This program shows us the negative impacts a delay can have.
Think of a use case where a car needs to stop for a stoplight for example and some delay is hindering the driver to do so.
The state diagram is rather simple with two states, one for [LED ON] and another for [LED OFF].
